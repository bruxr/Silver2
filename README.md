# Silver

## Development
1. Download [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/downloads.html).
2. Checkout Silver to a folder of your choice.
3. Inside the Silver directory, do `vagrant up` to spin up the VM. This may take a long time as this will download all the stuff Silver needs.
4. SSH into the VM by doing `vagrant ssh` then `rails s` to start the server.
5. Profit!
