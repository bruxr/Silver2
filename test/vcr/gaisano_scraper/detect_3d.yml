        Is this the official FB page of Gaisano Cinemas?\n\nThis is maintained by
        a movie fan, but the GMall Cinemas management recognizes this page.\nAdmin
        is not an employee of Gaisano Mall Davao nor its cinema. So please don''t
        demand \"customer service\" from the admin.\nThe admin updates the page as
        soon as the information is available. So if the information is not yet posted,
        it means the admin has not received information yet. So please just wait for
        the info to be posted.\nBelieving on the saying \"Give a man a fish, and you
        feed him for a day; teach him how to catch fish, and you feed him for a lifetime,\"
        the admin is asking peeps to read this FAQ first before posting questions
        because most questions are already answered here. It''s better that peeps
        will know how to explore our page rather than keep on asking questions. By
        reading this and not posting questions that already explained here, you are
        helping the admin in maintaining this page easily.\nWe will only be answering
        questions that are not stated here.\nThe admin can''t directly answer complaints\/other
        inquiries in behalf of the management. \n\n2 ) What''s the schedule this week?\n\nThe
        sked of the week is always pinned atop the main page. It contains the stars,
        genre, MTRCB rating, and running time, and the ticket prices. If the sked
        is only listed for a certain day, it means a new movie is set to debut after
        that day but the information has yet to be given. so please just wait for
        it to be posted. No need to asked where and why.\n\nFor particular info about
        the movies, please go to their respective pages posted at the NOW SHOWING\/SHOWING
        THIS WEEK album (https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.732319560119173.1073741840.130984640252671)\n\nPlease
        click the particular poster for more information (trailer, link). If the info
        such as rating or running time is not listed (especially on the first day),
        it means the info is not yet released by the management.\nIt is always on
        the afternoon before the opening of the movie that the running time schedule
        is posted here (Some distributors are giving the information late Tuesday
        afternoon). So, please don''t demand before Tuesday afternoon the time schedule
        of the movie opening on a Wednesday, and so on.\n\nSCHEDULE IS SUBJECT TO
        CHANCE WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE!\nSo please don''t scold the ticket seller if
        the sked posted here is different from the actual sked on the theaters. The
        management could have change the line-up without informing the FB admin.\n\nThe
        NOW SHOWING album is renamed MOVIES THIS WEEK on MONDAY or TUESDAY since the
        album already posted movies opening on the week. List is often updated on
        Tuesday, or a day before a new movie opens.\n\n3 ) Price of the ticket?\n\nTicket
        price varies per cinema. Please check the main wall post for the price of
        each movie.\nHere''s the general rate\nDavao\nCinema 1 (3D) (XTREME) - P130\/P200.
        no extra charge for the 3D glasses\nCinemas 2 to 4 - P110\/P130\nCinemas 5
        to 7 (VIP) - P130\nCinema 8 (Red Carpet) - P200\n\nToril\nCinemas 1, 2, 3,

        2 (VIP) - P130\nCinemas 3 to 6 - P130\n\nSeating capacity of the cinemas?\nDAVAO
        - Cinema 1 (upper deck - 126\/lower deck - 332); Cinema 2 (upper deck - 306\/lower
        deck - 364), Cinema 3 (upper deck - 322\/lower deck - 364), Cinema 4 (upper
        deck - 344\/lower deck- 390), Cinema 5 (306), Cinema 6 (185), Cinema 7 (175),
        Cinema 8 (106).\nTagum - Cinema 1 (upper deck - 245\/lower deck -233); Cinema
        2 (upper deck - 237\/lower deck - 221); Cinema 3 (254); Cinema 4 (209); Cinema

        3 (179); Cinema 3 (143)\n\n4 ) When will be the last day of this movie? Will
        this movie be extended? Is this movie still screening on (particular day)?\n\nWE
        CERTAINLY DON''T KNOW until when the movie will run because it all depends
        on the ticket sales of the existing day.\nA regular run of a movie is seven
        days. It usually starts on Wednesday and ends Tuesday the following week.
        Some expected blockbusters open on Thursday or Friday for a simultaneous US\/worldwide
        release. Friday is the usual opening date in US.\nBlockbusters generally command
        a week extension. If the movie opens in at least two movie houses, there is
        a possibility that it will run for another week.\nHowever, as general rule,
        movies are subject to change without prior notice -- they may be pulled out
        any time due to various reasons.\nIf the movie gets satisfying ticket sales,
        it will be extended for another week.\nIf it lacks ticket sales before the
        weekend, there will be two options: it will be pulled out before its week-long
        run or will be given a lesser run date (usually it will be played either in
        the morning or early afternoon). Having two (or more) movies screened in a
        cinema (one in the afternoon and another in the evening) is called slideshow.
        If the movie is in slideshow on its first week, it is due to weak ticket sales.
        There are also instances that movies need to be on a slideshow due to lack
        of movie houses (especially, if the movie is having strong box office, yet
        a batch of new movies are coming -- the management are forced to put those
        extended movies in one cinema). There are weeks that more than 8 movies are
        being released, and none of the distributors are willing to cancel the release.\n\nAs
        we repeatedly stated, schedule is subject to change without prior notice,
        so watch the movie as soon as you can before it will be pulled out unexpectedly.\nIt''s
        so annoying to read complaints regarding pulled-out movies.\n\n5 ) Schedule
        of the upcoming movies? Are you showing this movie?\n\nGo to NEXT PICTURE
        album page (for the movies opening in the following week or within the month).\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.482392871778511.119723.130984640252671\n\nGo
        to COMING SOON (for movies line-up for the rest of the year).\nwww.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.595094363841694.1073741830.130984640252671\n\nGo
        to IN PRODUCTION for in-production movies produced by major companies that
        are set in 2015 and beyond. The titles listed there are produced by major
        productions, but there are instance that they may not be distributed in the
        Philippines.\nwww.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.432606606757138.108635.130984640252671\n\nIf
        still, you can''t find the movie you''re looking for, please go to the BUMPED
        folder. This is for movies that were previously scheduled by the distributors
        but were later pulled out for distribution. So we have no information when
        they will be screened. They may or may not be screened at GMALL cinemas.\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.738068502877612.1073741841.130984640252671\n\nThere
        is a list of movies posted on the main page of NEXT PICTURE and COMING SOON.\n\nPosted
        schedule is tentative, as it is based on the movie release date in Manila.
        Some movies, particularly those non-blockbusters, may be delayed in the region.
        Again, the schedule is subject to change without prior notice!\n\nThere are
        instances that some movies may not be distributed in Davao or at GMall Cinemas.
        Other cinema chains are claiming exclusive rights on some movies, and we are
        not allowed to promote\/discuss such movies until we get confirmation that
        GMall Cinemas will be screening them on later date. We immediately pull out
        those movies on the album section if they are no longer listed for release
        at GMall Cinemas.\n\nIf the movie you are looking is not the above photo albums,
        here are the possibilities -- the movie was already screened (please go to
        the DONE albums), the movie will not be screened at GMall Cinemas, or the
        movie has no distributor yet (it may or may not be released in the future).\n\nDONE
        (latest quarter)\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.770266759657786.1073741843.130984640252671&type=3\n\nDONE
        (JAN-SEP 2014)\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.723288817688914.1073741839.130984640252671&type=3\n\nDONE
        (2013)\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.632259450125185.1073741835.130984640252671&type=3\n\n6
        ) The movie listed in NOW SHOWING section is different from the actual cinema
        schedule. Why?\nAs we are not online 24\/7, there are instances that we can''t
        update unexpected schedule changes. Schedules, as we stated above, are subject
        to chance without prior notice. But we always stride to post whatever is available.
        We may have no internet connection when the movie sked was change.  \nThere
        are several reasons for an unexpected changes. Among them are: permit doesn''t
        arrive on time, 2D\/3D material or its computer key doesn''t run, and weak
        ticket sales.\nGMall Cinemas can''t run a movie, even if it''s already on
        sked and approved by MTRCB, if there is no MTRCB permit sent to the cinema.
        GMall Cinemas can''t also run a movie if there is no available material.\nNo
        cinema will continue playing a movie if there''s a low audience turnout. Don''t
        wait for the movie to pass by, go to the cinema on the first day, if possible,
        if you think that the movie you like to watch is not a good ticket seller.
        Common examples for these are art, drama and indie films.\n\n7 ) Why the same
        3D price for a 2D movie on your Xtreme Cinema?\nOperating a 3D cinema is more
        expensive that 2D. At GMall Cinemas you are actually not paying for the 3D
        glass in its Xtreme Cinema, even if the movie is on 3D (unlike other cinemas
        that you are paying for the glass rental). It''s already the fixed price,
        with or without the 3D glass, 2D or 3D. It is the lowest 3D price in Davao.
        The P130 for the lower deck of Xtreme Cinema in Davao is just the same as
        the price of the VIP theaters (Cinemas 6 and 7) and the upper deck of our
        regular theaters (Cinemas 2 to 5). The P200 is the same as our Red Carpet
        (Cinema 8 ), both have lounge chairs.\n\n8 ) The movie was listed on NEXT
        PICTURE last week, yet it is not screening this week. Why?\nThose posted on
        the NEXT PICTURE are movies scheduled within the month. They are not all set
        for screening on the following week. Sometime, a movie is pulled out from
        its initial schedule by the distributor. The cinema doesn''t have control
        in that situation, it''s the distributor''s prerogative. Being marked BUMPED
        means that we don''t have current info on its release date. We will put the
        sked as soon as we have it.\n\n9 ) Will you extend a movie for another week?
        Will you still screen it again?\nAs general rule, only movie that generates
        enough ticket sale gets extension. If you think the movie you want to watch
        is not making money, prioritize it. Don''t reason us that you''re too busy
        to watch the movie on the date it is showing, and demand for it on your available
        time.\nBringing back a pulled-out movie rarely happens. If the movie was pulled
        out only after or less than a week of run, it means it is not selling well,
        therefore it is not getting a rerun. A movie only gets a rerun if there is
        a substantial public demand. The cinema can accommodate a special screening
        for a pull-out movie if the audience can reach a hundred. Sometimes, pulled-out
        movie is returned to the big-screen if a new film doesn''t make such money.\n\n10
        ) Is this movie in 3D?\nThe Xtreme Cinemas (one in Davao City and one in Tagum
        City) cater 3D movies. 3D movies are played on those cinemas. But on instances
        that there are no available 3D, 2D movies are instead played on Xtreme Cinemas.
        There are rare occasions that a 2D version of a 3D movie is screened on its
        3D cinema or a supposed 3D movie is released only on 2D (usually, the distributor
        is only releasing a 2D version). Our sked, found on our main wall, will always
        states if the movie is in 3D. \nSome customers are also demanding for a 3D
        version of a movie that actually doesn''t have a 3D version. Go check information
        on imdb.com if the movie has 3D version, or visit the movie page at impawards.com
        (the poster generally carries a 3D if it is released in 3D in US, but again
        not all 3D movies are released in 3D in the Philippines). Lastly, go to wikipedia.org,
        search the movie and read if the movie has a 3D version.\nIn instances that
        there are two 3D movies released on the same week, the cinema picks the movie
        that caters to the children (eg. animation over action movie). More children
        patronize 3D movies than adults. Or perhaps, there will be a slideshow.\n\n11
        ) Why move a 3D movie to a non-3D cinema.\nDue to high number of 3D movies,
        some 3D movies are moved to the 2D cinema on its second week to cater a new
        one. So again, watch the movie on the first week as possible instead of posting
        demand to extend a movie.\n\n12 ) Why screen a 2D version of a 3D movie?\nIt''s
        the distributor''s prerogative. If there are available 3D, the cinemas will
        be releasing a 3D version. If the distributor releases a 2D for a 3D movie,
        then the cinemas will be releasing 2D. If the movie carries a 3D in the title,
        the cinemas usually omit it on the non-3D release. But in some instances (eg.
        Piranha 3DD), we stick with the title even if the movie is not released on
        3D.\nThere are also instances that the film has both 3D and 2D, and there
        is only one cinema allocated for them (due to the influx of new movies opening).
        It is usually placed on Xtreme Cinema, yet we run sometimes the 2D version
        of the film in the night since some viewers don''t like to watch 3D. This
        give option to those who like to watch it on 3D to watch it on certain time,
        and for those who don''t like to watch on a certain time.\n\n13 ) What is
        3D? What is 2D?\nBoth 2D and 3D are digital.\n2D refers to two-dimensional.
        This basically means flat.\n3D equals three-dimensional. This refers to the
        added dimension of depth. Most modern movies have a 3D version, most of which
        require you to wear 3D glasses so that your eyes put the very odd-seeming
        pictures into an optical illusion that makes the image ''pop'' out at you.\nA
        3D cinema can play 2D movies but a 2D cinema can''t play a 3D movie.\nIn Davao
        City, Xtreme Cinema 1 is 3D, while the rest are in 2D.\nIn Tagum, Xtreme Cinema
        1 is 3D, while the rest are in 2D.\n\n14 ) Why this movie has so many cuts?\nCinemas
        don''t cut movies and have no right to cut a movie. It''s the MTRCB''s task,
        with the producer''s approval, to cut certain part(s) of the movie to get
        favorable rating. We can''t run anything that doesn''t pass the MTRCB.\nDon''t
        demand from the cinema to screen an uncut version. If you have problem about
        the cuts, raise your concerns to the MTRCB or to the production. So please
        don''t post such issue on our page.\n\n15 ) The movie is already released
        in Manila and pirated copies are already in the streets, why are you still
        not showing the film?\nAgain, it''s the distributors'' prerogative. The distributors
        could have delay the release of the movie to avoid competition against blockbusters.
        Also, some distributors have \"exclusive\" deals with other cinema chains
        on a particular movie. Certainly, we can not promote\/discuss those \"exclusive\"
        movies unless we got play dates (after the other cinemas screened it).\n\n16
        ) This movie is already released in Davao but not in Tagum and\/or Toril?
        Why the delay in Tagum\/Toril?\nLacks of cinemas. Davao has 8, Tagum has 6.
        and Toril has 4. As much as possible, the cinemas want to simultaneously release
        all the new titles. But since there are times that more than 10 movies are
        released in Manila, that even in Davao we have to prioritize movies that have
        potential strong box office.\n\n17 ) What''s the rating of the movie? Can
        children watch this movie?\nMTRCB ratings are only available for movie that
        is currently showing. The MTRCB info is listed in the NOW SHOWING sked on
        the main page.\nR18 = For adult only (Below 18 is not allowed).\nR16 = Children
        below 16 are not allowed.\nR13 = Children below 13 are not allowed.\nPG13
        = Children below 13 are only allowed if accompanied by parents or adults.\nG
        = General patronage, all ages are allowed.\n\n18 ) Are children free to watch
        movie?\nChildren, even a one-day-old baby, are subject to pay. We are advising
        moviegoers to avoid bringing infant or toddler who can''t appreciate movies
        yet. Children sometime cause disturbance (crying, shouting, running around,
        playing on chairs, etc). So if you are bringing children, please be responsible
        enough to take care of the children so others will not be disturbed.\n\n19
        ) Why the title of the movie you are releasing is not on its original title?\nIt''s
        the distributor''s prerogative to re-title the films they are releasing. We
        can''t change the title, even we know its actual title. The title used by
        the distributors is the one approved by the Movie and Television Review and
        Classification Board (MTRCB). But we put the IMBD and youtube links that carry
        the movie''s original title, or sometimes used its original poster. Distributors
        buy the films from the producers, and they have the right on how to market
        the product and make profit from it. It''s now a common practice to download
        or buy pirated copies, hence distributors will market that everyone will be
        enticed to watch it. If you complain that you have already seen the film before,
        blame yourself for illegally downloading or buying the pirated version of
        the film. Or go, complain the distributors.\n\n20 ) Is the date on the posted
        movie poster the actual date?\nNope, not all the time. The date on the poster
        usually reflects its US release, which usually falls on a Friday. Some movies
        are simultaneously released here, but most titles are not. As much as possible
        we want to put poster that doesn''t carry the date, but most posters carry
        US-release date. Please go to our coming soon photo album for the sked (check
        discussion somewhere above).\n\n21 ) What time the mall opens? the cinemas?
        Closing time?\nThe Davao City mall opens at 10 am. The cinemas opens at least
        10 minutes before the earliest time sked. If one of the movies is set to start
        at 10:30 a.m., the ticket booth opens at 10:20 a.m. Cinema''s regular last
        full show is 9:30 pm (Davao) and 9:00 pm (Tagum and Toril). So be there before
        that time. In Davao, guards at the side main entrance (beside San Pedro Hospital)
        allow patrons to enter before that time.\n\n22 ) What is a recliner chair?
        What is a lounge chair.\nFor recliner chair, view http:\/\/i01.i.aliimg.com\/photo\/v16\/233344483\/Hot_sale_Reclining_Cinema_Chair_HJ95B.jpg_140x140.jpg.\nRecliner
        chair is individual but its arm rest can be pulled up. In Davao, Cinema 1
        (lower deck, Cinemas 2 and 4 (upper deck) and Cinemas 6 and 7 use recliner
        chair. In Tagum, lower deck of Cinema 1 uses recliner.\nFor lounge chair,
        view http:\/\/www.harvestdualmoon.co.uk\/images\/sweet-dreams\/sw-sorbin-ch-500.jpg.
        Cinemas 1 (upper deck) and 8 use lounger chairs. Lounge chair is usually two-seater,
        but there are limited three-seater chairs in both cinemas.\n\n23 ) Complimentary
        passes are valid for?\nComplimentary pass is not valid for first-week run
        of major productions (especially expected blockbuster). There are some productions
        that don''t accept complimentary pass at all, and some only allow certain
        number. We put a list of movies accepting passes on our main wall. But since
        the acceptance of complimentary pass has limit and we are not online 24\/7,
        we could not certain what movies are still accepting passes even if we list
        down here. So whatever is posted is first-come-first-serve basis. Please call

        Davao City government, through a resolution, requesting theaters to accommodate
        the senior citizen. It is just a privilege given to the senior citizens. It
        is subject to certain conditions (eg. prohibition on first-week run, number
        of slot available). It''s a first come-first serve basis. Tagum has no such
        resolution.\n\n25 ) Can I make reservation? Is there a reservation for this
        movie?\nThere is no online reservation. To make reservation, please call (082)226-22-44

        also demand customers to observe proper decorum (turn off the cellphone, don''t
        put your feet\/shoes\/sandals atop the adjacent chair, observe silence, etc).
        The cinema is a public place, not your home. if you noted some customers are
        making loud unnecessary noise, please do inform the guard.\n\n29 ) Why the
        ban on this page?\nWe ban users for extreme reasons. Among them are threatening
        the admin, posting malicious and annoying messages, encouraging illegal download,
        promoting non-movie products, promoting other cinemas, badmouthing a movie,
        or posting a spoiler.\nThis is a page solely to promote movies scheduled at
        Gaisano Mall Cinemas in Davao and Tagum, hence rants or negative remarks against
        a movie are NOT welcome here. And certainly no spoiler.\nThis is not a critic
        page, and negative comments (against the movie, its poster, its production
        or its cast) certainly have no space here. You can post those rants on the
        facebook page of that particular movie. Your complaints against the movie
        are not our concerns and we don''t want to see such message on our page.\nMovie
        pirates who keep on bragging they have already seen the movie, or complaining
        that the movie is released to late, also have no place on this page.\nSo please
        don''t post if you have nothing good to say.\nQuestions on plot of the movie
        is not encouraged on this site. Please go to the official facebook page of
        the movie, or go to movie site to discuss movie plots.\nThe admin reserves
        the right to delete comments containing advertising, personal attacks, off-topic
        remarks, and any other objectionable content.\n\n30) The cinema has defect
        when I watched a movie. What to do? Where to report complain?\nFirst, inform
        the usherette about the defect (problem on sounds, etc). If there''s no usherette,
        call the attention of the guard or the porter. If the defect continues and
        it gives you discomfort, demand to see the supervisor. If it''s already after
        cinema office hour (past 7 pm), please have your complaint logged by the guard
        for future reference. (In Davao, guards are stationed at Cinema 5 during the
        last full show). So please don''t post here or PM us such complaint if you
        did nothing to inform the staff on the spot.\n\n31 ) Is this movie making
        money?\nSorry, movie box office gross will not be revealed.\n\n32) Why I see
        . (period) on the comment box on your album pictures?\nIt''s because you could
        have open it on the time that we are updating the page. We usually reserved
        the first four comment boxes to trailers, official website, links, etc. So
        please don''t demand us to post the trailers, just wait for it.\n\n33) What
        is a sneak preview? What is a premiere? What is a blocked screening?\nFor
